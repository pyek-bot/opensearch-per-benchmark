# OpenSearch PER Benchmark Enhancement Proposal

## Introduction

This document proposes several enhancements to the OpenSearch Personalized Entity Resolution (PER) Benchmark tool to improve its functionality, reliability, and user experience. The current benchmark tool successfully evaluates OpenSearch PER agents by sending test questions, retrieving responses, and evaluating them against expected outputs using Amazon Bedrock.

## Current State

The benchmark tool currently provides:
- OpenSearch server connectivity checking
- Asynchronous agent query execution
- Result retrieval and processing
- Response evaluation using Amazon Bedrock
- Execution time tracking via server-side timestamps
- Result storage and basic metrics

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Parallel Test Execution

**Description:** Implement parallel execution of test cases to reduce overall benchmark runtime.

**Implementation:**
- Use Python's `concurrent.futures` module for managed thread pool
- Allow configurable concurrency limit to prevent server overload
- Add option to disable parallel execution for debugging

**Benefits:**
- Significantly reduced benchmark runtime for large test sets
- Better utilization of available resources
- More realistic load testing capability

### 2. Enhanced Result Visualization

**Description:** Provide visual representation of benchmark results through charts and graphs.

**Implementation:**
- Add matplotlib/seaborn integration for report generation
- Create charts for:
  - Response time distribution
  - Rating distribution
  - Comparative performance between test runs
- Export visualization as PNG/PDF for sharing

**Benefits:**
- Easier identification of performance patterns
- Better communication of benchmark results
- More accessible metrics for non-technical stakeholders

### 3. Continuous Benchmarking Support

**Description:** Enable integration with CI/CD systems for automated benchmark runs.

**Implementation:**
- Add support for CI-friendly output formats (JUnit XML, GitHub Actions annotations)
- Implement comparison with baseline results to detect regressions
- Add webhook notifications for benchmark completion
- Store historical benchmark data for trending analysis

**Benefits:**
- Automated performance regression detection
- Integration with existing CI/CD workflows
- Historical performance tracking

### 4. Advanced Agent Configuration

**Description:** Support testing multiple agent configurations in a single benchmark run.

**Implementation:**
- Allow multiple agent IDs in configuration
- Run identical test sets against each agent
- Generate comparative metrics between agents
- Support agent configuration templating

**Benefits:**
- Direct comparison between agent configurations
- Easier optimization of agent parameters
- A/B testing capability for agent enhancements

### 5. Test Case Categorization and Tagging

**Description:** Add metadata to test cases for better organization and analysis.

**Implementation:**
- Extend test case schema to include tags and categories
- Allow filtering benchmark execution by tags
- Generate segmented reports by category
- Track performance metrics by category

**Benefits:**
- More granular analysis of agent performance
- Focused testing on specific capability areas
- Better organization of large test sets

### 6. Failure Analysis Tools

**Description:** Improve debugging capabilities for failed tests.

**Implementation:**
- Capture full agent execution context for failed tests
- Implement detailed failure categorization
- Add regression detection for previously passing tests
- Generate targeted improvement recommendations

**Benefits:**
- Faster diagnosis of agent issues
- More actionable feedback for developers
- Focused improvement efforts

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (Near-term):**
   - Parallel test execution implementation
   - Enhanced result visualization
   - Test case tagging support

2. **Phase 2 (Mid-term):**
   - Continuous benchmarking integration
   - Multiple agent comparison
   - Failure analysis tools

3. **Phase 3 (Long-term):**
   - Historical performance trending
   - Advanced statistical analysis
   - Integration with OpenSearch Dashboards

## Required Resources

- Development time: ~4-6 weeks for Phase 1
- Additional dependencies:
  - matplotlib/seaborn for visualization
  - concurrent.futures (standard library) for parallelization
  - pandas for data analysis

## Expected Outcomes

- 50-70% reduction in benchmark runtime for large test sets
- More comprehensive evaluation of agent performance
- Better integration with development workflows
- Earlier detection of performance regressions
- More actionable insights from benchmark results

## Conclusion

These enhancements will transform the OpenSearch PER Benchmark from a basic testing tool into a comprehensive evaluation and optimization platform. The proposed features will improve development efficiency, enable better performance tracking, and provide more actionable insights for improving agent performance.
